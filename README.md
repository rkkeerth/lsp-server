# LSP Server

A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation providing rich language features for development environments.

## About

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is an open standard that defines a common protocol for how editors and IDEs communicate with language servers. This protocol enables language-specific features such as autocomplete, go-to-definition, find-all-references, and more to work across different development tools.

This project implements an LSP server that can be integrated with any LSP-compatible editor or IDE, providing intelligent code assistance and analysis capabilities.
